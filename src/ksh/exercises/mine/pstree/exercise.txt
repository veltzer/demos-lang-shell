Pstree in ksh/bash 
==================
Create a pstree like program in ksh.
It should look like this:

$ ./mypstree.bash
init-+-sshd
     +-apache-+
	      +apache
     +-syslogd

stage1: Call ps to create a temp file with the data you need
(program cmd line, pid -> process id, ppid -> parent process id )

stage2: Read the information from the file you created into variables
(arrays) in your program.

stage3: Print the tree, start with process id 1 (init).

stage4: streamline your program. Get ridd of any temporary files and make your
program as fast as possible. This is the hardest part.
