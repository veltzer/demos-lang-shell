#!/bin/bash

# this example shows the equivalent of a 'pass' statement
# in bash. This is the 'true' shell builtin which executes really
# quickly and succeeds.
# Note that this 'pass like' statement is needed and removing it
# will lead to syntax error. Replacing it with a comment will not work
# either.
