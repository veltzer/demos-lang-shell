# This example shows how to use logical operators when using the '['/'test' shell builtin.
# Note that '[' and '[[' are not the same as '[[' is a shell keyword and not a shell
# builtin and behaves differently.
# Also note that GNU in it's coreutils has a process implementation of both '[' and 'test'
# but these are not usually used as the shell builtins are preferred by bash.
# Notes:
# - if you want to see the documentation of '['/'test' *dont do 'man ['*. Instead
# look at man builtins and look for 'test'.
# - if you wish to do logical operators combined with '[' you must use -a, -o and more.
