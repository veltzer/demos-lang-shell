<<'COMMENT'

This is an example of doing profiling in bash using the date(1) utility and bc(1).

Notes:
- this is a very clean way of doing profiling.
- unlike the 'time' based solution the function in this solution is running in the same
shell and not in a subshell.
- the solution does not change what the function outputs.
