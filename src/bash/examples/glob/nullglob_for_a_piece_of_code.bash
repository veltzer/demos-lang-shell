shopt -s nullglob
for x in /tmp/doesntexist*.foo; do echo $x; done
shopt -u nullglob

# in order to return nullglob to it's former state we need to store
# it's previous state.

function save_nullglob() {
	nullglob=$(shopt -p nullglob)
	shopt -s nullglob
}

function restore_nullglob() {
	$nullglob
}

save_nullglob
for x in /tmp/doesntexist*.foo; do echo $x; done
restore_nullglob
