# This is an example of how to iterate properly all the command line arguments.
# You can test this by giving arguments of like this:
# $ ./command_line.bash arg1 arg2 "this is the third arg"
# and seeing that the script packs all the third argument correctly.
# in bash, unlike in other scripting languages, the first argument is a real
# argument and NOT the name of the script.

# the right way to iterate an array
for elem in "$@"

	echo $elem
done
echo "size of the array is $#"
