<<COMMENT

- evaluates the content of the comment (bad)
$$foo is fine, not because it is not evaluated but rather because
$$ is seen as the variable (current shell pid).
- it will allow single quotes (') (good)
- you can continue the comment until COMMENT appears (good)
- chages $? (bad)

$$foo (single $ will cause an error, bad)
${a=5} (evaluated, bad)

COMMENT

echo $a, $?

false

: '

- wont evaluate the content of the comment (good)
- cannot use single quotes (bad)
- the comment continues until a single quote (bad)
- chages $? (bad)

${a=6} (not evaluated, good)

'
echo $a, $?

false
