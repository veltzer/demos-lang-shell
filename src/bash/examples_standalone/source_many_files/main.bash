<<'COMMENT'

This example shows that you cannot source more than one file in single bash 'source' command.
The loop which follows is the right way to do it.
Another thing that does work is the cat example.

Another issue is what happens if there are no files matching the pattern.
In this case just doing the for loop is not enough so we have to do
one of the following:
- only apply the glob after we checked that there are files matching the glob
as in the example of the 'compgen -G' below.
- use the shell option 'shopt -s nullglob' and 'shopt -u nullglob'

# this does not work:
# -will only source the first file
# -will fail if there is no file matching the pattern
source subfolder/*.bash

# this one checks if there are matches before doing
# regular shell globbing
# so this handles the case where there are no matches.
# it is long though
if compgen -G "subfolder/*.bash" > /dev/null; then
	for x in subfolder/*.bash; do
		source $x
	done
fi

# the following example does handle the case where there are no matches
# the difficulty is that we need to return the status of the shell 'nullglob'
# setting to it's original state and we do not do that here.
shopt -s nullglob
for x in subfolder/*.bash; do
	source $x
done
shopt -u nullglob

# this handles no matches and is short
for x in $(compgen -G "subfolder/*.bash"); do
	source $x
done

# will fail if there is no file matching the pattern
source <(cat subfolder/*.bash)
